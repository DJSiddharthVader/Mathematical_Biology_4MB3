$I^*=0$ is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium, so to prove that all solutions to the SIR model approach $I=0$ asymptotically stability cannot be assessed using the linearization theorem.
However, the existance of a Lyapunov function would be able to prove the stability of these eqiuilibria.
A function $L(S,I)$ is a Lyapunov function if:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item $L(S^*,I^*) = 0$
    \item $L(S,I) > 0 \quad \forall (S,I) \in \mathbb{R^2} \char`\\ \{S \in \mathbb{R},I=0 \}$
    \item $\nabla L(X) \cdot X' < 0 \quad \forall X \in \mathbb{R^2}\char`\\ \{X_*\}$
\end{enumerate}
If a Lyapunov function exists for the equilibrium point $(S^*,I^*)$ then that point is asymptotically stable.
We consider the function $L(S,I) = I$ and check whether it is a valid Lyapunov function for the eqilibria $(S^*,I^*) = (S,0)\quad \forall S \in \mathbb{R}$:
\begin{align*}
    L(S^*,I^*) &= I^* = 0\\
    L(S,I)     &= I > 0\\
\end{align*}
Note $I >0$ since we are examining the endemic equilibrium whch includes al values in $(0,1]$ since $I=0$ is the equilibrium point and thus not considered.
Now we shoe that $\dot{L}(S,I) < 0$
\begin{align*}
    \dot{L}(S,I) &= \nabla L(S,I) \cdot X'\\
                 &= \frac{\partial L}{\partial S}\cdot \frac{dS}{dt}\\
                 & = 0 + (1)\frac{dI}{dt}\\
                 &={\mathcal R_0}SI -I\\
                 &=I({\mathcal R_0}S-1)
    0            &> I({\mathcal R_0}S-1) \label{eq:1}\\
\end{align*}
Since $I > 0$ $L(S,I) = I$ is a Lyapunov function when ${\mathcal R_0}S -1 < 0 \implies {\mathcal R_0} < \frac{1}{S}$ which holds for all cases as $S \to S^*$.
This proves that $L(S,I) = I$ is a strict Luapunov function and that the equilibria $(S^*,I^*) = (S,0)\quad \forall S \in \mathbb{R}$ is asymptotically stable.\par
As the infection spreads, individuals move from the succeptible class to the infected class while individuals move from the infected class to the recovered class.
As there in never an increase in the succeptible class the number of individuals entering the recovered class will be greater than the number of individuals entering the infected class.
The number of individuals in the infected class will continuously decrease as people recover and $I \to 0$.

If the bio-terrorists were able to double the early rash stage of smallpox, this will greatly increase the reproductive ratio $\mathcal R_0$ by nearly doubling what was calculated for the unaltered strain of the disease ($\mathcal R_0 \simeq 5$). Increasing $\mathcal R_0$ will increase the critical proportion of vaccinated individuals in the population from $75\%$ to $95\%$ in order to prevent an epidemic. Without intervention, the final size of an  epidemic caused by the unaltered strain is estimated to be $95\%$. 	With the altered strain, the final size of the epidemic without any intervention will be similar but much closer to $100\%$. Thus it is imperative to implement vaccination, isolation, and quarantine intervention methods as soon as possible.

If the bio-terrorists were able to double the early rash stage of smallpox, this will greatly increase the reproductive ratio $\mathcal R_0$ by nearly doubling what was calculated for the unaltered strain of the disease ($\mathcal R_0 \simeq 5$). Increasing $\mathcal R_0$ will increase the critical proportion of vaccinated individuals in the population from $80\%$ to $90\%$ in order to prevent an epidemic. Without intervention, the final size of an epidemic caused by the unaltered strain is estimated to be $99\%$. 	With the altered strain, the final size of the epidemic without any intervention will be similar but much closer to $100\%$. Potentially creating a viable pre-epidemic vaccination to the susceptible population will be effective in decreasing  $\mathcal R_0$ and moreover will decrease the estimated final size of an epidemic. If an effective vaccine can be mass implemented to reach $20\%$ of the United States population, then the reproductive ratio can be decreased to $80\%$ of the original estimated $\mathcal R_0$ and reduce the final size estimation accordingly. Additionally, if an outbreak happens, isolating individuals when they enter the extremely infectious (early rash) stage of the disease will have greatest impact on decreasing $\mathcal R_0$. Thus it is imperative to implement vaccination, isolation, and quarantine intervention methods as soon as possible.

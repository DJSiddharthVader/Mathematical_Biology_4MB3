\section{Executive Summary}
\par Cholera is a water-borune disease that affects three to five million people and causes 100,000 - 120,000 deaths yearly. The disease dynamics of cholera are discussed and used to form a SIRW model. This model was used to test the effectiveness of the three main treatment strategies for cholera outbreaks. When analyzed--it was found that ---\\
\par As there is a spatial componenet to cholera dynamics, a spatial model was developed and once more used to analyze the effect of treatment strategies in a way that (bettter simulated real life scenarios?). Of interest to the (PHAC), we showed that----. 
Therefore, implementing this treatment strategy is--\\
\par Although cholerra is not a major health concern in Canada, the dynamics of this proposed model hold true for multiple water-borne diseases, of which ----

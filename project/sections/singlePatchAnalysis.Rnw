The basic reproductive number ${\mathcal R_0}$ is defined as the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible
population.
${\mathcal R_0}$ can be computed as the spectral radius (i.e. the eigenvalue with the largest absolute value) of the next generation matrix at the disease free equilibrium.
The next generation matrix $FV^{âˆ’1}$, where entry $F_{ij}$ of the matrix $F$ is the rate at which infected individuals in compartment $j$ produce new infections in compartment $i$, and the entry of $V_{ij}$ of the matrix $V$ is the mean time spent in compartment $j$ after moving into $j$ from compartment $k$.
For our model, we have
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{align*}
		F&=\begin{pmatrix}
			\beta_I & \beta_w\\
			0 & 0
			\end{pmatrix}\\
		V&=\begin{pmatrix}
			\frac{1}{\gamma+\mu+\alpha} & 0\\
			\frac{1}{\gamma+\mu+\alpha} &\frac{1}{\sigma}
			\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
\end{linenomath}
The basic reproductive number is computed as the spectral radius of $FV^{-1}$ as seen in \cite{link9}, which is
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{align*}
    {\mathcal R_0} &= \rho(FV^{-1})\\
		           &=\frac{\beta_i+\beta_w}{\gamma+\mu+\alpha}
\end{align*}
\end{linenomath}
This single patch model has a stable disease-free equillibrium at (S,I,R)=(1,0,0) when ${\mathcal R_0}<1$.
It also has a stable endemic-equillirbium when ${\mathcal R_0}>1$.

There are no diseases that display recurrent epidemics for which the SIR model with vital dynamics is adequate to explain the observed epidemic dynamics. From results in parts (g) and (h), given that $\R_0 > 1$ (such that an epidemic occurs) the EE is GAS and that for all initial conditions, $I(0) > 0, S(0) > 0$, the system approaches the EE with damped oscillations. Additionally, by observing the Jacobian evaluated at the EE, the complex eigenvalues have negative real part and non-zero imaginary part, implying that the dynamics are always oscilatory. Thus recurrent epidemics with no evidence of damping out (like measles) cannot be explained by the SIR model with vital dynamics.
